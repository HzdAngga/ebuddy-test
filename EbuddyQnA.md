# Personality & technical Questions

## Q1. Based on this URL link https://www.reddit.com/settings (login into Reddit). Without looking at the code base, which part of the settings page is NOT server side.

### ANSWERS:

To be frank, i dont want to login/create account in reddit, but i believe in that setting page there should be a toggle switch button that when its toggled, it will automatically change account settings yes? That part is definetely NOT server side. Or if its not automatically save the changes, there should be Save button to hit API for change the account behavior. That Save button also a part that is NOT server side.
That is the most safe answer, but honestly i believe the best practice for developing private page like this settings page should NOT use SSR for security and server performance. Should use CSR instead. So, all of parts in this page should NOT use SSR.

## Q2. What are the most difficult technical problems in your work experience you have encountered and how do you fix them?

### ANSWERS:

Fixing some errors in edge cases like "only happens in windows device or slow internet". To fix them, first i need to reproduce them in environment that reported, and then identifying suspicious codes after get some clues from reproduce step and do little research/googling/discuss with coworkers to fix them.

## Q3. When you’re working on a project, how do you typically approach it from start to finish?

### ANSWERS:

Finish all MVP features (but still think about tidiness), functionality over everything at start, and then styling, enhancing, refactor for finishing.

## Q4. How do you usually approach learning a new topic to absorb as much as possible?

### ANSWERS:

- Find reliable materials from the official website (example: learning about Ant Design => go to the https://ant.design/) or find tutorial in youtube or both. and then implement by writing code or creating mini project

- Searching solution from stack overflow or googling if found error while implementing

- Discuss with co-workers or friends

## Q5. “Consistency” vs “fast & efficient”. Choose one.

### ANSWERS:

Depends on situation. For Example:
_Situation 1: Develop a Small Project/Bigger from scratch with Tight Timeline (1-2 months for developing CMS type full with BE, FE, deploy, 10+ pages with form style, etc + QA and bugfixing):_
I will prioritize fast & efficient first and if i have much time (miraculously finish all the functionality/MVP features faster than timeline), i will enhance the code like refactor for example for consistency.
**Conclusion: in this situation => fast & efficient > consistency**

_Situation 2: Develop a Large Project NOT from scratch (in most cases: just continuing the codes/features) with long timeline (6 months+):_
I will prioritize consistency since the functionality/MVP features has already reached. And then after i adapted how the code style works, i will slowly fasten the writing code.
**Conclusion: in this situation => consistency > fast & efficient**

_Situation 3: Develop a Large Project from scratch with long timeline (1 year+):_
I will prioritize fast & efficient first for half year or until the MVP features are reached, and then for the remaining time will be used for boosting consistency.
**Conclusion: in this situation => both, cant choose one**

## Q6. Do you own any Apple products? Like IMac, Macbook, Ipad, Iphone, etc…

## Q7. What is your immediate availability to start this job?
